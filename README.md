# Verifo

**250+ service emulators on local Docker — Stripe, Postgres, Slack, S3, OpenAI and more, speaking real wire protocols.**

A verification layer for AI coding agents (and a "mock everything locally" tool for everyone else).

```bash
SERVICES="postgres,redis,stripe,openai,slack" docker compose up
```

That's it. Five real services are now listening on `localhost` — Postgres on
5432, Redis on 6379, Stripe on 4757, and so on. Point your app at them with
**unmodified real drivers** and run your code. No accounts, no API keys, no cost,
no side effects.

## Why

Code that talks to databases, payment APIs, queues and SaaS needs testing. Today
you either:

- **Mock everything** — fast, but mocks lie and miss real bugs.
- **Use the real services** — accurate, but slow, costs money, needs secrets,
  and has side effects (real charges, real emails).

Verifo is the third option: **real wire protocols, in-memory, instant, free.**
The Postgres emulator speaks the actual Postgres protocol — `psycopg`/`pg`
connect unmodified. The Stripe emulator speaks the real Stripe REST API —
`stripe-node` works as-is. Your code is identical to production; only the
endpoint changes.

This is especially useful for **AI coding agents**: an agent can spin up exactly
the services its code touches, run it, assert, and tear down — all locally, all
free, with zero risk to production.

## Quick start

**With the CLI (zero install):**

```bash
npx verifo up postgres redis stripe   # start (foreground)
npx verifo up stripe -d               # or detached
npx verifo status                     # what's running
npx verifo ls payments                # browse the catalog by category
npx verifo reset                      # wipe all state between tests
npx verifo down                       # stop the detached fleet
```

See [`docs/cli.md`](./docs/cli.md) for every command.

**With Docker (collision-safe):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dksingh1997/verifo && cd verifo
npm install   # one-time, for the launcher

# start just what you need
SERVICES="postgres,redis,stripe" npm run up

# or everything
SERVICES=all npm run up
```

`npm run up` publishes only the ports for the services you ask for, and if a
port is already taken on your machine (a local Postgres on 5432, say) it
remaps that one service to a free port and tells you which one:

```
parlel: 1 host port(s) were busy — remapped to free ports:
  • postgres: connect on localhost:15000 (container 5432)
```

Plain `docker compose up` also works if you'd rather — see
[`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml).

**With plain `docker run`:**

```bash
docker build -t verifo .
docker run -p 5432:5432 -p 4757:4757 -e SERVICES="postgres,stripe" verifo
```

**Without Docker (pure Node, no install needed):**

```bash
SERVICES="postgres,redis,stripe" node src/launch.mjs
```

Then use the services with your normal drivers:

```python
import psycopg, redis, stripe

db    = psycopg.connect("postgres://parlel:parlel@localhost:5432/parlel")
cache = redis.Redis(host="localhost", port=6379)
stripe.api_base = "http://localhost:4757"
stripe.api_key  = "sk_test_parlel"
```

```js
import pg from "pg";
import Stripe from "stripe";

const db = new pg.Client("postgres://parlel:parlel@localhost:5432/parlel");
const stripe = new Stripe("sk_test_parlel", { host: "localhost", port: 4757, protocol: "http" });
```

See [`examples/`](./examples) for a runnable end-to-end flow, and
[`.env.example`](./.env.example) for every service's port + seeded test
credentials.

## Real protocols, not stubs

Each emulator implements the actual wire protocol or REST contract, verified
against the real client libraries. The test suite connects with `pg`, `redis`,
`mysql2`, `mongodb`, `kafkajs`, `amqplib`, `cassandra-driver`, the AWS SDK,
Stripe, and more — and asserts real round-trips.

```bash
npm install      # dev deps: the real driver libraries + vitest
npm test         # per-service fidelity tests
npm run probe    # boot a set and health-check every service
```

## Configuration

- **`SERVICES`** — comma-separated slugs, or `all`. Defaults to `postgres,redis`.
- **Ports** — each service uses its canonical port (see `.env.example`).
- **Credentials** — seeded test values (e.g. `sk_test_parlel`); any non-empty
  value is accepted, so you rarely need to change them.

## Control plane

Alongside the emulators, Verifo runs an additive admin server on
`localhost:4600`. Open it **in a browser** for a live dashboard — every running
service, its connection string, the request log, a state inspector, and reset
buttons, auto-refreshing every 2 seconds.

You can also drive it programmatically. List what's running, inspect state, and —
most usefully — reset every service to a clean slate between tests without
restarting anything:

```js
beforeEach(() => fetch("http://127.0.0.1:4600/reset", { method: "POST" }));
```

`GET /services` returns each service's port and a ready-to-use connection string.
You can also inspect the request log (`GET /services/:slug/requests` — "did my
code call the API the way I think it did?") and preload fixtures
(`POST /services/:slug/seed`, or a `parlel.fixtures.json` loaded on boot).
See [`docs/control-plane.md`](./docs/control-plane.md). Disable with
`PARLEL_CONTROL=0`.

## How it works

```
your app / agent  ──▶  localhost:<port>  ──▶  in-memory emulator (real protocol)
   (unchanged)         (no bridge, no proxy)      (ephemeral, zero side effects)
```

Each emulator is dependency-free Node holding state in memory. State is
ephemeral — restart for a clean slate. No data ever leaves your machine.

Everything runs locally, so the **official client libraries connect directly** —
`psycopg`/`pg` to `localhost:5432`, `kafkajs` to `localhost:9092`, `redis` to
`localhost:6379`, and so on. There is no proxy, no bridge, and no shim: the
TCP services (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Cassandra, Redis) speak
their real wire protocols straight to the port. (Kafka advertises
`localhost:9092` in its metadata, so `kafkajs` reconnects land on the emulator.)

## Add a service

Adding an emulator is a manifest + a `server.js` + a test. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — it takes about five minutes.

## For AI agents

Verifo ships an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server so agents can drive
the emulators by tool call — start services, run code against them, then **read
the request log to verify what the code actually did**:

```bash
npx verifo-mcp
```

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for the agent workflow and [docs/mcp.md](./docs/mcp.md)
for client setup (Claude Desktop, Cursor, …).

## Roadmap

- ~~MCP server so agents can drive services by tool call.~~ ✅ Shipped — see
  [docs/mcp.md](./docs/mcp.md).
- Record / replay against real upstreams.
- More services (open an issue to request one).
